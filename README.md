## 👩‍💻Project Overview
I downloaded this dataset from Kaggle and worked on it by myself using skills from my data science classes. The Salary Prediction Project aims to predict salaries based on years of experience. Using linear regression, I got about 96% accuracy on the training data and 95% on the testing data, showing that the model is reliable and effective.
